# top-gdp-project

In this practice project, you will put the skills acquired through the course to use and create a complete ETL pipeline for accessing data from a website and processing it to meet the requirements.

## project scenario

An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated.
